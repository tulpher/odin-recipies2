        <li>8 slices Thick-Cut Bacon</li>
        <li>2 Heirloom Tomatoes</li>

        <li>Working in batches if necessary, fry bacon in a large skillet over high heat until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Transfer to a large cutting board.</li>
        <li>While bacon cooks, slice tomato crosswise into thin rounds. Transfer to a plate and marinate with red wine vinegar, 1 tablespoon olive oil, salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Spread toast generously with mayonnaise on one side, follow with remaining Â½ tablespoon olive oil.</li>
        <li>Divide the tomatoes with some of their vinegar marinade among 2 slices of toast. Top with the lettuce.</li>
