    <h3 class="header">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Sausage</li>
        <li>Bell Peppers</li>
        <li>Italian Seasoning</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>Red Pepper Flakes</li>
        <li>Garnishes (Green Onion and Basil)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="header">Steps</h3>
    <ol class="list">
        <li><strong>Cook the Sausage.</strong> Heat a tablespoon of the olive oil in a large skillet, set over medium heat. Add the sliced sausages and cook them until theyâ€™re nicely browned, stirring and turning occasionally. This should take about 5 to 6 minutes. Remove the cooked sausage from the skillet, and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Vegetables.</strong> Now we increase the heat to medium-high. Add the remaining olive oil to the skillet. Stir in the julienned peppers and onions, sprinkling them with the Italian seasoning. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, or until crisp tender and a little charred. Then add the garlic, salt, and pepper; continue to cook for 1 more minute.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish the Dish.</strong> Return the cooked sausage back to the skillet and cook for 1 minute, or just until heated through. Taste the dish for salt and pepper and adjust if needed. Garnish with pepper flakes, green onions, and basil, if using.</li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong> Serve your sausage and pepper skillet as-is, or arrange it over rice or noodles.</li>
